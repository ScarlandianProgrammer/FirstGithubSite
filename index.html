        <h2>This is my first webpage made with Github Pages</h2>

        <p>
            This website isn't meant to be anything crazy, just a little example of
            my competence of how to properly use Github and other such web services.
        </p>

        <p>
            As you can tell, I've spent so much time on this, and I'm sure that it'll
            look fantastic. I'm still getting used to using Github, so that is the main
            test for today. (Link to my Github is in the footer.)
